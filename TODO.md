# Metaprogramming Invoking Library (MIL)
The file contains various library to-do lists.

If you picked one of the "planned" activities, please make sure, nobody else doing the same!

## Plan
* [ ] Add testing framework
* [ ] Adapt for clang/vs
* [ ] Cover more use-cases (now library supports only `void getter(params...)`)
* [ ] Pretty errors (currently library has no any user-friendly errors notification)

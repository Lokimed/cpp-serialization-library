# Metaprogramming Invoking Library (MIL)

MIL provides a really simple and fast way of automatically invoke methods (and chains of methods) of any object.

Please Note, it's the very beginning of the library, and the code now is mosly simple PoC (proof of concept), rather than a good library

### Prerequisites

* The library is well tested with **GCC-9.2.1**, please use it for better results
* **cmake-3.0.0**

## Building

* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
* `./test/demo` - to run the small demo

## Running the tests

Tests are not ready yet, to be filled once tests are added

## Coding style

* We're using K&R coding style.
* The identation is 4 spaces

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
